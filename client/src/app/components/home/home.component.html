        <h2>1. Why leanr coding?</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="p-content">
          Many children learn a second language in the first few years of their life, so why wait to
          expose them to coding?

        <br>
        <p class="p-content">
          In BlockSchool's 3D world, children can do BIG things using very little code. Due to
          BlockSchool's Scratch-like programming language, they don't even need to type!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="p-content">
          The best part? Kids love it.

        <h2>2. Why online? Why not in person?</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="p-content">
          a. Finding an incredible class with great teachers in your area can be hard if not impossible
          depending on where you live. Finding private 1-on-1 instruction is even harder.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="p-content">
          b. Since teachers live in many different time zones, MEGAkid has classes available
          whenever you want them. You can schedule, reschedule, and cancel at any time too.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="p-content">
          c. Sixty to 90 minute classes are optimized to make money, not to maximize your child's
          learning per minute. MEGAkid classes are 40 minutes, and we've found this works well
          given a fun project-based curriculum.
        </p>

        <h2>3. What's "Project-Based Learning?"</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="p-content">
          Project-based learning is based on a simple concept: humans learn by doing. Although this
          concept doesn't shound novel, it is rarely practiced in schools. Most schools force children to
          listen to long lectures, and then test whether they memorized them.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="p-content">
          Instead, we put the child in the driver's seat. They are in charge of what they want to learn.
          They choose a project they want to pursue, and our teachers help them achieve their goal.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="p-content">
          If we want to encourage students to be critical thinkers and problem solvers, we must give
          them opportunities to practce those skills.
